Notes:
I have not worked with the RabbitMQ before so what I did was googling and using Chatgpt to learn about it. Then I started just with creating S1 and queue and tried seeing the UI of queue. Then I was able to generate the S2 and keep going with them.
All AI tools that I used was from Intelij to help with filling the codes and when it was a mistake I fixed it and also used the Chatgpt with correct prompts to undesrtand the RabbitMQ and its functinality.

Final Note:
I had so many issues running the java 8 b/c of spring boot version so I had to use java 17 instead although I know the requirment was using the java 8. I will attach some errors b/c of java 8 here also.
